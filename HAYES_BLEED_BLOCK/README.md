# Hayes Bleed Block
My daily bicycle that I ride everywhere in Marseille, from the street workout 
area to the bar, is a Decathlon RockRider 540 ```RR540 Blk XL``` that I bought 
back in around 2016.
It comes equipped with an hydraulic disk brake line from Hayes named 
```Radar```.

The front and back brakes were both spongy and braking had became kind of
inexistant.
